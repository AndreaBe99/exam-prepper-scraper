## Question 2 (ID: Question 9)

You are managing an application deployed on Cloud Run for Anthos, and you need to define a strategy for deploying new versions of the application. You want to evaluate the new code with a subset of production traffic to decide whether to proceed with the rollout. What should you do?

### Options:
- **A)** Deploy a new revision to Cloud Run with the new version. Configure traffic percentage between revisions. **(Correct Answer)**
- **B)** Deploy a new service to Cloud Run with the new version. Add a Cloud Load Balancing instance in front of both services.
- **C)** In the Google Cloud Console page for Cloud Run, set up continuous deployment using Cloud Build for the development branch. As part of the Cloud Build trigger, configure the substitution variable TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE with the percentage of traffic you want directed to a new version.
- **D)** In the Google Cloud Console, configure Traffic Director with a new Service that points to the new version of the application on Cloud Run. Configure Traffic Director to send a small percentage of traffic to the new version of the application.

**Your Answer:** A
**Result:** ✅ Correct

## Question 3 (ID: Question 32)

Your operations team has asked you to help diagnose a performance issue in a production application that runs on Compute Engine. The application is dropping requests that reach it when under heavy load. The process list for affected instances shows a single application process that is consuming all available CPU, and autoscaling has reached the upper limit of instances. There is no abnormal load on any other related systems, including the database. You want to allow production traffic to be served again as quickly as possible. Which action should you recommend?

### Options:
- **A)** Change the autoscaling metric to agent.googleapis.com/memory/percent_used.
- **B)** Restart the affected instances on a staggered schedule.
- **C)** SSH to each instance and restart the application process.
- **D)** Increase the maximum number of instances in the autoscaling group. **(Correct Answer)**

**Your Answer:** D

You need to improve the performance of the application. What should you do?

### Options:
- **A)** 1. Mount the Cloud Storage bucket using gcsfuse on all backend Compute Engine instances. 2. Serve music files directly from the backend Compute Engine instance.
- **B)** 1. Create a Cloud Filestore NFS volume and attach it to the backend Compute Engine instances. 2. Download popular songs in Cloud Filestore. 3. Serve music files directly from the backend Compute Engine instance.
- **C)** 1. Copy popular songs into CloudSQL as a blob. 2. Update application code to retrieve data from CloudSQL when Cloud Storage is overloaded.
- **D)** 1. Create a managed instance group with Compute Engine instances. 2. Create a global load balancer and configure it with two backends: ג—‹ Managed instance group ג—‹ Cloud Storage bucket 3. Enable Cloud CDN on the bucket backend. **(Correct Answer)**

## Question 5 (ID: Question 69)

The application reliability team at your company this added a debug feature to their backend service to send all server events to Google Cloud Storage for eventual analysis. The event records are at least 50 KB and at most 15 MB and are expected to peak at 3,000 events per second. You want to minimize data loss.
Which process should you implement?

### Options:
- **A)** ג€¢ Append metadata to file body ג€¢ Compress individual files ג€¢ Name files with serverName ג€" Timestamp ג€¢ Create a new bucket if bucket is older than 1 hour and save individual files to the new bucket. Otherwise, save files to existing bucket.
- **B)** ג€¢ Batch every 10,000 events with a single manifest file for metadata ג€¢ Compress event files and manifest file into a single archive file ג€¢ Name files using serverName ג€" EventSequence ג€¢ Create a new bucket if bucket is older than 1 day and save the single archive file to the new bucket. Otherwise, save the single archive file to existing bucket.
- **C)** ג€¢ Compress individual files ג€¢ Name files with serverName ג€" EventSequence ג€¢ Save files to one bucket ג€¢ Set custom metadata headers for each object after saving
- **D)** ג€¢ Append metadata to file body ג€¢ Compress individual files ג€¢ Name files with a random prefix pattern ג€¢ Save files to one bucket **(Correct Answer)**

**Your Answer:** A
**Result:** ❌ Incorrect
